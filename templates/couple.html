        <p class="thin"> Maya and Keshal did, in fact, meet in Miami over spring break. They were there separately, but met
          through a common friend (Hey, Swati!). Back at Barnard/Columbia, while Keshal was courting Maya, he would dutifully
          walk her back to Plimpton on 121st and Amsterdam, claiming that it wasn't safe for her to walk that way by herself.
          That abruptly stopped the moment she agreed to date him :/

        <br class="is-hidden-touch">
        <br class="is-hidden-touch">
        <p class="thin"> After college, Maya moved back to India. Keshal stayed in NYC. They did looooong distance for 2
          loooong years. That was hard. But they saw each other once a year on trips they took together to Spain, Croatia
          and Serbia.
          <br/></br>
          In 2013, Maya moved to Boston for Business School. They were still in a long distance relationship, but at least they were
          in the same time zone! The next three and a half years were filled with long bus rides, packed weekends, and dread-filled
          Sundays when one or the other got on a bus to head back home.

        <p class="thin"> In February, 2017, Keshal moved to Boston, putting an end to 5 years of long distance. Now, Sundays
          mean fresh brewed coffee, decadent homemade breakfasts and Otis Redding on the record player. </br>
          </br>
          Last June, the two took a trip to Portugal, where Keshal proposed on a lookout point over a beach. Maya was surprised, but
          not as surprised as when they went to dinner that night and found both their parents and siblings sitting at the
          restaurant. Suffice it to say, she cried. A LOT.

      <div id="couple-8" class="column column-couple-text is-5">
        <p class="thin"> The two have since built a life together with all the trappings of millennial domesticity - a Slack
          channel where they decide what to make for dinner on weeknights, a cast iron pan that Keshal lovingly seasons,
          and a plant family that Maya named and Keshal nurtures (Rupert, Chaco, Clemence, Esmerelda and Earl).
